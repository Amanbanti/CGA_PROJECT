#This is a text from the lessons

#Lesson-1:Programming for a Purpose
-Did and submit the survey
-Choose Animation and Game Design Templates


#lesson-2:Plotting Shapes
-under this lesson i learned drawing shapes on a given grid by selecting the shapes and 
 the color. 
#lesson-3:Drawing in Game Lab
-introduction to the game lab

// Change the thickness of the rectangle outline.
strokeWeight(20);
rect(50, 50, 100, 200);

 Change the numbers inside the block, then try running the program again.
// Try to place the rectangle near the bottom right of the screen.
rect(349,349);

#//Place Squares in Corners
//1) Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen
rect(0,0);
rect(350,350);

fill(color)
//2) Change the color from blue to yellow.
fill("yellow");
rect(100,100);
rect(250, 100);
//3) Add a new square to the image
rect(350,350)

# Fill a collor for a different shapes
here under this leason i catch a basid understandin of how to fill a color for different shapes 
with the differen color we want.
// 2) Change the color from blue to yellow.
fill("yellow");
rect(100,100);
rect(250, 100);
// 3) Add a new square to the image
rect(350,350);

# Order Matters
-under this part i learned that how the order of the code we write affect the intended shape.
-so under matters.
-//2) Change the red rectangle's color to green.
//3) Change the order of the code so the green rectangle appears on top.
fill("green");
rect(175,175);
fill("blue");
rect(200, 200);

#Drawing a circle using the ellispse()
#Drawing a car by using the shapes we learned in the lessong before 
#Debugging the code in order to get the intended shape.
