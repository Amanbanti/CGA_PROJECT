#This is a text from the lessons

#Lesson-1:Programming for a Purpose
-Did and submit the survey
-Choose Animation and Game Design Templates


#lesson-2:Plotting Shapes
-under this lesson i learned drawing shapes on a given grid by selecting the shapes and 
 the color. 
#lesson-3:Drawing in Game Lab
-introduction to the game lab

// Change the thickness of the rectangle outline.
strokeWeight(20);
rect(50, 50, 100, 200);

 Change the numbers inside the block, then try running the program again.
// Try to place the rectangle near the bottom right of the screen.
rect(349,349);

#//Place Squares in Corners
//1) Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen
rect(0,0);
rect(350,350);

fill(color)
//2) Change the color from blue to yellow.
fill("yellow");
rect(100,100);
rect(250, 100);
//3) Add a new square to the image
rect(350,350)

# Fill a collor for a different shapes
here under this leason i catch a basid understandin of how to fill a color for different shapes 
with the differen color we want.
// 2) Change the color from blue to yellow.
fill("yellow");
rect(100,100);
rect(250, 100);
// 3) Add a new square to the image
rect(350,350);

# Order Matters
-under this part i learned that how the order of the code we write affect the intended shape.
-so under matters.
-//2) Change the red rectangle's color to green.
//3) Change the order of the code so the green rectangle appears on top.
fill("green");
rect(175,175);
fill("blue");
rect(200, 200);

#Drawing a circle using the ellispse()
#Drawing a car by using the shapes we learned in the lessong before 
#Debugging the code in order to get the intended shape. 
rearrenge the code.

#LESSON 4
This topic explores how parameters control the appearance of shapes by customizing their size, position, and other attributes. Key concepts include:

Shapes: Use commands like ellipse(x, y, w, h) and rect(x, y, w, h) to create and adjust shapes by specifying width, height, and position.
Customization: Add colors using fill(color) and set the background with background(color).
Practice: Experiment with shape parameters to debug and create designs like clouds, polygons, and arcs.

LESSON 5: VARIABLES
Description: Learned to use variables to store and manage information, making programs more dynamic and reusable.
var size = 100;
fill("green");
ellipse(200, 100, size, size);

var eyeSize = 27;
ellipse(160, 170, eyeSize, eyeSize);
Random Numbers with randomNumber():
ellipse(randomNumber(0, 400), 200, 50, 50);

LESSON 7: ROBOT FACE
Description: Created a robot face using polygons, ellipses, and rectangles to practice designing with geometric shapes.

regularPolygon(200, 175, 6, 90); // Head
fill("white");
ellipse(165, 150, 20, 20); // Eyes
rect(170, 200, 56, 10); // Mouth

LESSON 8: SPRITES
Description: Explored sprites to create interactive animations and manage objects on the canvas.
var sprite = createSprite(200, 200);
sprite.setAnimation("textGetReady");
drawSprites();

Dynamic Background and Objects:
background("lightblue");
ellipse(randomNumber(0, 400), 50); // Sun
regularPolygon(randomNumber(0, 400), 300, 3, 250); // Mountains
