## Lesson1:problem-solving within the design process, divided into four key stages:

    Define:
        Identify potential users and their needs through interviews and profiles.

    Prepare:
        Connect user needs to specific problems, research existing solutions, brainstorm ideas, and assess their feasibility.

    Try:
        Create sketches of the product and develop low-stakes prototypes for user feedback.

    Reflect:
        Present findings to stakeholders and review the feedback received from users.

This process encourages iterative development and user-centered design.
the word search game also interesting and also brainstorming
designs in animation and game design. Key features include:

    Customizable Sections: Users can add different shapes and colors to organize their design.
    Zoom Functionality: A magnifying glass tool allows for zooming in and out for detailed work.
    Image Integration: Users are encouraged to incorporate images into their designs.
    This template provides a flexible framework for creative design planning.

Client Design Selection
Tatiana: “I run a business that makes greeting cards...”
Defining Sentence:

    Tatiana needs a way to create interactive digital greeting cards in order to engage users with humor and creativity.

Design Preparation

    Images: Cute cartoon characters, humorous puns, interactive elements (like buttons).
    Colors: Bright and cheerful colors like yellow, pink, and light blue.
    Text: Instructions for interaction, punchlines for the puns.

Prototype Creation

    Sketch Ideas: Draw the layout of the card, indicating where images and text will be placed, and mark interactive areas.

Reflection

    Strength: The design effectively uses humor and interactivity to engage users, making it enjoyable.
    Improvement Area: The user instructions could be clearer to ensure all users understand how to interact with the card.
## Lesson 2:Plotting Shapes 
    - learned how to draw shapes using the tool & Replicated the Car.
## Lesson 3 Drawing in Game lab
    - learned how to color the shapes.
    - learned how make in the perfect position in right place.
    by using the code like rect(0,0,0,0); 
    the first two numbers are indicate position of the shapes x and y 
    the last two numbers indicate size of the shapes width and height.
    there is also a command stroke("any color here");
    and also a command fill("any color here");
    the fill command is inside coloring shapes.
    the stroke command is border coloring of a shapes.
    we should have to use the fill command before the shape command to fill the color proprly.
    the is also noFill();
                noStroke(); 
                strokeWeight(size);
                ellipse(x,y,w,h);....
    2-Try to place the rectangle near the bottom right of the screen.

           rect(350, 350);

    1-Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen

           rect(0,0);
           rect(350, 350); 

    2-Change the color from blue to yellow.and Add a new square to the image

           fill("yellow");
           rect(200,100);
           rect(50, 100);
           rect(50, 200);

    2-Change the red rectangle's color to green.
    3- Change the order of the code so the green rectangle appears on top.

           fill("blue");
           rect(200, 200);
           fill("green");
           rect(175,175);

    2-Add a new ellipse of a different color.

           fill("yellow");
           ellipse(100, 200);

    2-Rearrange the code so the wheels are visible.

           fill("dimgray");
           ellipse(150,325);
           ellipse(250,325);
           fill("red");
           rect(100,250);
           rect(150,250);
           rect(200,250);
           rect(250,250);
           rect(150,200);
           rect(200,200);

    2-Change the code so that all the petals are attached to the center of the flower.

           fill("purple");
           ellipse(200,165);
           ellipse(160, 195);
           ellipse(180, 235);
           ellipse(226, 230);
           ellipse(240, 186);
           fill("yellow");
           ellipse(200,200);

    2-Rearrange the code so the colors are correct.

           fill("black");
           rect(175,100);
           rect(175,150);
           rect(175,200);
           fill("red");
           ellipse(200,125);
           fill("yellow");
           ellipse(200,175);
           fill("green");
           ellipse(200,225);

    Drawing a car with correct color position and shape

           fill("green");
           rect(100,250);
           rect(150,250);
           rect(200,250);
           rect(250,250);

           fill("purple");
           rect(150, 150);

    2-Use the point() block to finish the code so it matches the picture.

           strokeWeight(35);
           point(200, 170);
           strokeWeight(5);

           point(200, 210);

        
## Lesson 4
     I have learnt some additional commands like regular polygon the first two parameters indicate the x and y axis the last two parameters indicate the side numbers the polygon and another parameter indicate the size of the polygon
     shape command has the parameter x1,y1.........
    one command knowledge gained which is background(color)
           fill("blue");
           rect(120,100,80,150);
           fill("red");
           rect(250,100,80,200);

    1- Add an orange ellipse to the screen that is taller than the green one
    2-Rearrange the blocks so the orange ellipse is behind the green one
    
           fill("orange");
           ellipse(200, 200, 250, 350);
           fill("green");
           ellipse(200,200,200,150);
    2-Change the background from yellow to orange.
            fill("purple");
            rect(50,50, 100,100);
            background("orange");
            fill("blue");
            rect(250,250, 100, 100);
    1-Make a black background behind the green circle.
             fill("green");
             background("black");
             ellipse(200,200,200,200);
             
 // Draw sky
background("skyblue");

// Draw sun
fill("yellow");
ellipse(350,50,50,50);

// Draw grass
fill("green");
rect(0,350,400,50);

1-Debug the code so the picture shows on the right.
       fill("red");
       ellipse(200, 200, 400, 400);
       fill("orange");
       ellipse(200, 200, 340, 340);

        regularPolygon(50, 275, 11, 50);
        regularPolygon(152, 275, 12, 50);
        regularPolygon(252, 275, 13, 50);
        regularPolygon(350, 275, 14, 50);
// compelete the shape 
    fill("red");
    shape(200, 200, 0, 400, 400, 400);
    fill("blue");
    shape(200, 200, 0, 0, 400, 0);
    fill("yellow");
    shape(200, 200, 400, 400, 400, 0);
