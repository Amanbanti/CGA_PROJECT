### Lesson 1: Problem-Solving in Design  

The design process includes four main stages:  

1.Define:  
   - Understand user needs through interviews and profiles.  

2.Prepare:  
   - Identify problems, research solutions, brainstorm ideas, and assess feasibility.  

3.Try:  
   - Draft product sketches and create simple prototypes for feedback.  

4.Reflect:  
   - Share findings with stakeholders and refine designs based on user input.  

This iterative process prioritizes user-centered design and continuous improvement.

### Programming Lessons Recap  

#### Lesson 1: Purposeful Programming  
- Completed a survey and chose Animation and Game Design templates.  

#### Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes  
- Learned to draw and color shapes on a grid.  

#### Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab  
- Explored shapes and created basic designs.  

##### Highlights:  
1. Outline Thickness :  
   strokeWeight(20);
   rect(50, 50, 100, 200);


2. Positioning :  
   - Place a rectangle at the screen's bottom-right:  
     rect(349, 349);
    

3. Corner Placement :  
   - Draw shapes in corners:  
     rect(0, 0);
     rect(350, 350);
 

4.Adding Colors:  
   - Change a shape's color:  
     fill("yellow");
     rect(100, 100);
     

5.Code Order:  
   - Writing order impacts shapes:  
     fill("green");
     rect(175, 175);
     fill("blue");
     rect(200, 200);
  

6. Shape Combination :  
   - Designed a car and debugged code to achieve proper output.
