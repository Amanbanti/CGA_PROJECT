# Lessons

## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose  
- Explored the **Activity Guide** to understand user needs.  
- Recommended templates to clients based on the target audience, purpose, and platform:  
  - **Educational Games for Children:** Maria - Template E (Interactive and simple for reading practice).  
  - **Environmental Animation:** Richard - Template D (Clean skies and nature-focused).  
  - **Text-Based Block:** Layla - Template B (Pre-structured for easy adaptation).  
  - **Interactive Animation:** Emma - Template C (Replace chickens with sharks for thematic relevance).  
  - **Comic and Space Game:** Levi - Template A (Engages users interested in sci-fi).  
- Completed a survey on identifying the purpose of games and animations.

## Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes  
- Learned how to use grids and axes to draw shapes accurately on the screen.  
- Followed instructions to replicate a car design using shapes on **Game Lab's grid**.  
- Experimented with placing shapes using the `rect()` function:
  - Example: Placed a rectangle in the bottom-right corner using `rect(350,350);`.  
  - Added two rectangles in the corners:  
    ```javascript
    rect(0,0);  
    rect(350,350);
    ```  
  - Changed the color of a rectangle:  
    ```javascript
    fill("yellow");  
    rect(100,100);  
    rect(250,100);
    ```

## Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab  
- Predicted outputs of shapes drawn with `rect()` and confirmed their behavior in the program.  
- Experimented with code by modifying shapes' positions and colors.  
  - Example: Added a new square:  
    ```javascript
    rect(200,200);  
    rect(300,400);  
    rect(100,350);
    ```  
  - Explored the impact of code order:  
    - Initially drew a red rectangle followed by a blue rectangle.  
    - Modified the red rectangle to green and changed the order to display it on top:  
      ```javascript
      fill("blue");  
      rect(175,175);  
      fill("green");  
      rect(200,200);
      ```
