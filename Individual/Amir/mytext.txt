# Lessons

## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose  
- Explored the **Activity Guide** to understand user needs.  
- Recommended templates to clients based on the target audience, purpose, and platform:  
  - **Educational Games for Children:** Maria - Template E (Interactive and simple for reading practice).  
  - **Environmental Animation:** Richard - Template D (Clean skies and nature-focused).  
  - **Text-Based Block:** Layla - Template B (Pre-structured for easy adaptation).  
  - **Interactive Animation:** Emma - Template C (Replace chickens with sharks for thematic relevance).  
  - **Comic and Space Game:** Levi - Template A (Engages users interested in sci-fi).  
- Completed a survey on identifying the purpose of games and animations.

## Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes  
- Learned how to use grids and axes to draw shapes accurately on the screen.  
- Followed instructions to replicate a car design using shapes on **Game Lab's grid**.  
- Experimented with placing shapes using the `rect()` function:
  - Example: Placed a rectangle in the bottom-right corner using `rect(350,350);`.  
  - Added two rectangles in the corners:  
    ```javascript
    rect(0,0);  
    rect(350,350);
    ```  
  - Changed the color of a rectangle:  
    ```javascript
    fill("yellow");  
    rect(100,100);  
    rect(250,100);
    ```

## Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab  
* Predicted outputs of shapes drawn with `rect()` and confirmed their behavior in the program.  
* Experimented with code by modifying shapes' positions and colors.  
  - Example: Added a new square:  
    
    rect(200,200);  
    rect(300,400);  
    rect(100,350);
    ```  
* Explored the impact of code order:  
* Initially drew a red rectangle followed by a blue rectangle.  
* Modified the red rectangle to green and changed the order to display it on top:  
      
      fill("blue");  
      rect(175,175);  
      fill("green");  
      rect(200,200);
      ```  
* Working with Ellipses
Learned how to use the ellipse() function to create circles on the canvas.
Added ellipses with different colors and positions:

    fill("teal");
    ellipse(100, 100);

    fill("orange");
    ellipse(200, 200);
* Debugging - Fix a Car
Observed that the red body of the car was hiding the wheels.
Rearranged the blocks so the wheels appeared on top of the car body:

// Rearranged the code to make the wheels visible
fill("dimgray");
ellipse(150, 300);
ellipse(250, 300);

fill("red");
rect(100, 250);
rect(150, 250);
rect(200, 250);
rect(250, 250);
rect(150, 200);
rect(200, 200);

* Debugging - Rearrange Code for Correct Output
Reviewed the buggy code meant to create a specific design.
Rearranged and modified the code to match the intended picture:

// Corrected the code to match the instructions
fill("orange");
ellipse(150, 150);
ellipse(200, 150);
ellipse(150, 200);
ellipse(200, 200);

fill("purple");
rect(150, 150);

* Drawing Points - Ladybug
Used the point() and strokeWeight() functions to draw a ladybug on the screen.
Completed the code by adding missing blocks to match the picture.
Added legs to the ladybug as a challenge:

// Drawing the ladybug
strokeWeight(35);
point(200, 170);

strokeWeight(5);
fill("red");
ellipse(200, 200);
point(200, 190);
point(210, 200);
point(190, 200);
point(200, 210);

This session focused on debugging and creative use of shapes and points to produce the desired visual designs, reinforcing the importance of code order and precise positioning.
