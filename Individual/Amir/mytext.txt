# Lessons

## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose  
- Explored the **Activity Guide** to understand user needs.  
- Recommended templates to clients based on the target audience, purpose, and platform:  
  - **Educational Games for Children:** Maria - Template E (Interactive and simple for reading practice).  
  - **Environmental Animation:** Richard - Template D (Clean skies and nature-focused).  
  - **Text-Based Block:** Layla - Template B (Pre-structured for easy adaptation).  
  - **Interactive Animation:** Emma - Template C (Replace chickens with sharks for thematic relevance).  
  - **Comic and Space Game:** Levi - Template A (Engages users interested in sci-fi).  
- Completed a survey on identifying the purpose of games and animations.

## Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes  
- Learned how to use grids and axes to draw shapes accurately on the screen.  
- Followed instructions to replicate a car design using shapes on **Game Lab's grid**.  
- Experimented with placing shapes using the `rect()` function:
  - Example: Placed a rectangle in the bottom-right corner using `rect(350,350);`.  
  - Added two rectangles in the corners:  
    ```javascript
    rect(0,0);  
    rect(350,350);
    ```  
  - Changed the color of a rectangle:  
    ```javascript
    fill("yellow");  
    rect(100,100);  
    rect(250,100);
    ```

## Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab  
* Predicted outputs of shapes drawn with `rect()` and confirmed their behavior in the program.  
* Experimented with code by modifying shapes' positions and colors.  
  - Example: Added a new square:  
    
    rect(200,200);  
    rect(300,400);  
    rect(100,350);
    ```  
* Explored the impact of code order:  
* Initially drew a red rectangle followed by a blue rectangle.  
* Modified the red rectangle to green and changed the order to display it on top:  
      
      fill("blue");  
      rect(175,175);  
      fill("green");  
      rect(200,200);
      ```  
* Working with Ellipses
Learned how to use the ellipse() function to create circles on the canvas.
Added ellipses with different colors and positions:

    fill("teal");
    ellipse(100, 100);

    fill("orange");
    ellipse(200, 200);
* Debugging - Fix a Car
Observed that the red body of the car was hiding the wheels.
Rearranged the blocks so the wheels appeared on top of the car body:

// Rearranged the code to make the wheels visible
fill("dimgray");
ellipse(150, 300);
ellipse(250, 300);

fill("red");
rect(100, 250);
rect(150, 250);
rect(200, 250);
rect(250, 250);
rect(150, 200);
rect(200, 200);

* Debugging - Rearrange Code for Correct Output
Reviewed the buggy code meant to create a specific design.
Rearranged and modified the code to match the intended picture:

// Corrected the code to match the instructions
fill("orange");
ellipse(150, 150);
ellipse(200, 150);
ellipse(150, 200);
ellipse(200, 200);

fill("purple");
rect(150, 150);

* Drawing Points - Ladybug
Used the point() and strokeWeight() functions to draw a ladybug on the screen.
Completed the code by adding missing blocks to match the picture.
Added legs to the ladybug as a challenge:

// Drawing the ladybug
strokeWeight(35);
point(200, 170);

strokeWeight(5);
fill("red");
ellipse(200, 200);
point(200, 190);
point(210, 200);
point(190, 200);
point(200, 210);

This session focused on debugging and creative use of shapes and points to produce the desired visual designs, reinforcing the importance of code order and precise positioning.


## Lesson 4: Shapes and Parameters

## Guess and Verify Shape Behavior
This exercise asked us to predict how parameters like width and height affect the appearance of rectangles. After making predictions, we ran the code to see the actual result.

fill("blue");
rect(100, 100, 100, 200);
fill("red");
rect(250, 100, 100, 150);

## Make Red Rectangle Longer
Modified the parameters of the second rect() to make the red rectangle longer than the blue one.

fill("blue");
rect(100, 100, 100, 150);
fill("red");
rect(250, 100, 100, 200);

## Orange Ellipse Behind Green Ellipse
What the exercise did: Added an orange ellipse taller than the green one and arranged the code so the orange ellipse appears behind the green ellipse.

fill("orange");
ellipse(200, 200, 240, 300);
fill("green");
ellipse(200, 200, 200, 150);

## Change Background and Display All Shapes
Changed the background to orange and rearranged the code so the purple square was visible alongside the blue square.

fill("purple");
rect(50, 50, 100, 100);
background("orange");
fill("blue");
rect(250, 250, 100, 100);

## Black Background for Green Circle
Added a black background behind a green circle while ensuring proper order of blocks.

background("black");
fill("green");
ellipse(200, 200, 200, 200);

## Extend Grass to Cover Bottom
Fixed an error to ensure the grass rectangle extends across the entire bottom of the screen.

// Draw sky
background("skyblue");
// Draw sun
fill("yellow");
ellipse(350, 50, 50, 50);
// Draw grass
fill("green");
rect(0, 300, 400, 100);

## Rearrange Rainbow Ellipses
Rearranged blocks to display rainbow-colored concentric ellipses in the correct order.

fill("red");
ellipse(200, 200, 400, 400);
fill("orange");
ellipse(200, 200, 340, 340);
fill("yellow");
ellipse(200, 200, 280, 280);
fill("green");
ellipse(200, 200, 220, 220);
fill("blue");
ellipse(200, 200, 160, 160);
fill("indigo");
ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);
fill("violet");
ellipse(200, 200, 40, 40);

## Adjust Cloud Shape
Debugged parameters of an ellipse to make the cloud wider than it is tall.

// Draw sky
background("skyblue");
// Draw sun
fill("yellow");
ellipse(300, 50, 50, 50);
// Draw grass
fill("green");
rect(0, 350, 400, 100);
// Draw cloud
fill("white");
ellipse(150, 100, 200, 100);

## Add Polygons to Complete Image
Added missing polygons using regularPolygon() to create a pattern with increasing sides in each row.

regularPolygon(50, 75, 3, 50);
regularPolygon(150, 75, 4, 50);
regularPolygon(250, 75, 5, 50);
regularPolygon(350, 75, 6, 50);
regularPolygon(50, 175, 7, 50);
regularPolygon(150, 175, 8, 50);
regularPolygon(250, 175, 9, 50);
regularPolygon(350, 175, 10, 50);
regularPolygon(50, 275, 11, 50);
regularPolygon(150, 275, 12, 50);
regularPolygon(250, 275, 13, 50);
regularPolygon(350, 275, 14, 50);
